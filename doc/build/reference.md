# Reference

### The ``Docs`` submodule

```
addhook(func)
```

> Register a function to be called on each docstring prior to storing it.


**Usage:**

```julia
using Docile.Docs

reverser(str, def) = (reverse(str), def)

addhook(custom)

addhook() do str, def
    # ...
end
```

**Note:** registered hooks are only applied to docstrings written after the hook is added.
```
directives(str, def)
```

> Docsystem hook for executing `{{...}}` directives embedded in docstrings.


**Usage:**

```julia
module MyModule

using Docile.Docs

addhook(directives)

"{{...}}"
f(x) = ...

end
```


---

### The ``Directives`` submodule

```
directive""
```

> Shorthand syntax for defining a directive.


```julia
parsebracket(:: directive"", text) = ...
```
```
withdefault(func, directive)
```

> Set the default directive to use within the call to `func`.


**Usage:**

```julia
withdefault(:custom) do
    # ...
end
```
```
parsebracket(directive :: Directive, text)
```

> User-extensible syntax hook.


Extending this function allows for handling of `{{custom:...}}` syntax.

**Example:**

To define a directive that reverses the text it contains:

```julia
using Docile.Directives
Directives.parsebracket(:: directive"reverse", text) = reverse(text)
```

Now when

```md
{{reverse:hello world}}
```

is parsed it will result in the following output:

```md
dlrow olleh
```
