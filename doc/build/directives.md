# Directives

Directives refer to the syntax `@{...}` which can be used to embed arbitrary user-defined code and domain specific languages inside docstrings and external documentation read be `makedocs`.

## Usage

Directives are called using the syntax `@{<name>:<text>}` where `<name>` is some valid Julia identifier containing only letters and `<text>` is the content to be passed to the directive. If no `<name>` is provided then the default directive, `docs` is called.

To enable directives inside docstrings `addhook(Docile.Docs.directives)` must be called at the start of the module before any docstrings.

## Available Directives

### `esc`

Escape a directive.

**Example:**

```
@{esc:foobar:
...
}
```

will result in

```
@{foobar:
...
}
```

### `docs`

Retrieve documentation from the Julia help system and embed it in place of the directive. The syntax is the same as that used in the REPL `?` mode.

**Example:**

```
@{foobar}
```

Multiple docstrings can be embedded with a single directive by separating each query with a newline.

```
@{
    foo
    bar
    baz
}
```

### `repl`

Simulate a Julia REPL session within a docstring. A new module is defined for each `repl` block so that variables do not leak between them. Lines ending with `;` will not display their output.

```
@{repl:
julia> a = 1;
julia> b = 2
julia> a + b
}
```

### `example`

Run a code block and display it's result afterwards. A new module is used for each `example` block in the same way as for `repl` blocks.

```
@{example:
A = [x + y for x = 1:3, y = 2:4]
b = [1, 2, 4]
A \ b
}
```
