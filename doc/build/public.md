# Package Reference

```
makedocs()
```

Generate markdown documentation from templated files.

**Keyword Arguments:**

`source = "src"`

Directory to collect markdown files from. The provided path is treated as being relative to the directory in which the build script is run.

`build = "build"`

Destination directory for output files. As with `source` the path is relative to the build script's directory.

`clean = false`

Should the build directory be deleted before building? `external` files are not affected by this.

`external = Dict("README.md"=>"../README.md")`

User-defined files that, if found in `source`, will be written to the provided paths rather than the default in `build`. `makedocs` writes `README.md` files to the parent folder by default. This can be disabled by setting `external = Dict()`.

**Usage:**

Import `Docile` and the modules that should be documented. Then call `makedocs` with any additional settings that are needed.

```jl
using Docile, MyModule

makedocs()                   # Without any customisations.
makedocs(source = "../docs") # With a source folder called ``docs`` in the directory one up.
makedocs(clean = true)       # Clean out build directory before building.
```

---
```
doctest(mod; submodules = true)
```

Test all Julia code blocks found in a module's docstrings.

By default all submodules are also checked. This can be disabled by setting the `submodules` keyword to `false`.

`doctest` returns a `Results` object that contains the results of all tests.

See also: `details`.

---
```
details(results; all = false)
```

Display details of a doctest. Information provided includes:

  * status of the test (either `Passed` or `Failed`)
  * module and object names
  * value returned after evaluating the code block
  * contents of the code block

By default only the failed code blocks will be displayed when calling `details`. To see all the results pass the keyword argument `all = true`.
